;;; org-rifle.el --- Rifle through your Org files

;; Author: Adam Porter <adam@alphapapa.net>
;; Url: http://github.com/alphapapa/org-rifle
;; Version: 2.0-pre
;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "24.4") (dash "2.12") (f "0.18.1") (s "1.10.0"))
;; Keywords: hypermedia, outlines

;;; Commentary:

;; This is my rifle.  There are many like it, but this one is mine.
;; My rifle is my best friend.  It is my life.  I must master it as I
;; must master my life.

;; What does my rifle do?  It searches rapidly through my Org files,
;; quickly bringing me the information I need to defeat the enemy.

;; This package is inspired by org-search-goto/org-search-goto-ml.  It
;; searches both headings and contents of entries in Org buffers, and
;; it displays entries that match all search terms, whether the terms
;; appear in the heading, the contents, or both.  Matching portions of
;; entries' contents are displayed with surrounding context to make it
;; easy to acquire your target.

;; Entries are fontified by default to match the appearance of an Org
;; buffer, and optionally the entire path can be displayed for each
;; entry, rather than just its own heading.

;;; Installation:

;;;; MELPA

;; If you installed from MELPA, your rifle is ready.  Just run one of
;; the commands below.

;;;; Manual

;; Install packages `dash', `f', and `s'.  Then require
;; this package in your init file:

;;   (require 'org-rifle)

;;; Usage:

;; Run one of the rifle commands, type some words, and results will be
;; displayed, grouped by buffer.  Hit "RET" to show the selected
;; entry, or <C-return> to show it in an indirect buffer.

;; Occur commands: show results in an occur-like, persistent buffer
;; + `org-rifle': Show results from all open Org buffers
;; + `org-rifle-agenda-files': Show results from Org agenda files
;; + `org-rifle-current-buffer': Show results from current buffer
;; + `org-rifle-directories': Show results from selected directories; with prefix, recursively
;; + `org-rifle-files': Show results from selected files
;; + `org-rifle-org-directory': Show results from Org files in `org-directory'

;;;; Tips

;; FIXME: Update tips for org-rifle refactor.

;; + Select multiple entries in the Helm buffer to display selected
;;   entries in a read-only, `occur`-style buffer.
;; + Save all results in a Helm buffer to a `org-rifle`
;;   buffer by pressing `C-s` (like `helm-grep-save-results`).
;; + Show results from certain buffers by typing the name of the
;;   buffer (usually the filename).
;; + Show headings with certain to-do keywords by typing the keyword,
;;   e.g. `TODO` or `DONE`.
;; + Show headings with certain priorities by typing, e.g. `#A` or
;;   `[#A]`.
;; + Show headings with certain tags by searching for,
;;   e.g. `:tag1:tag2:`.
;; + Negate matches with a `!`, e.g. `pepperoni !anchovies`.
;; + Sort results by timestamp or buffer-order (the default) by
;;   calling commands with a universal prefix (`C-u`).
;; + Show entries in an indirect buffer by selecting that action from
;;   the Helm actions list, or by pressing `<C-return>`.
;; + The keymap for `org-rifle` results buffers imitates
;;   the `org-speed` keys, making it quicker to navigate. You can also
;;   collapse and expand headings and drawers with `TAB` and `S-TAB`,
;;   just like in regular Org buffers.  Results buffers are marked
;;   read-only so you cannot modify them by accidental keypresses.
;; + Delete the result at point in `org-rifle` buffers by
;;   pressing `d`.  This does not alter the source buffers but simply
;;   removes uninteresting results from view.
;; +  You can customize the `org-rifle` group if you like.

;;; Credits:

;; This package is inspired by org-search-goto (specifically,
;; org-search-goto-ml).  Its unofficial-official home is on
;; EmacsWiki[1] but I've mirrored it on GitHub[2].  It's a really
;; great package, and the only thing that could make it better is to
;; make it work with Helm.  To avoid confusion, this package has a
;; completely different name.

The path of that entry would normally be displayed as:

And that might be fine.  But if there were a lot of other matches
around that place in the tree, seeing the first several elements
of the paths repeated might make the results appear more similar
than they are, and when the path is long, the most unique
part (the last element) might be obscured by wrapping (depending
on Org faces).  So it might be better to show the paths reversed,
like:

elfeed\\HTML-related\\Libraries\\Development\\Emacs\\Software\\Computers

Note that the separator is also \"reversed\" to indicate that the
paths are reversed.  Also, when `org-rifle-fontify-headings'
is enabled, the fontification typically makes it obvious that the

(defcustom org-rifle-test-against-path nil
  "Test search terms against entries' outline paths.
When non-nil, search terms will be tested against each element of
each entry's outline path.  This requires looking up the outline
path of every entry that might be a match.  This significantly
slows down searching, so it is disabled by default, and most
users will probably prefer to leave it disabled.  Also, when it
is disabled, the outline paths of matching entries can still be
displayed (if `org-rifle-show-path' is enabled), without the
performance penalty of looking up the outline paths of even
non-matching entries.

However, enabling it may provide more comprehensive results.  For
example, consider the following outline:

* Emacs
** Org-mode
** Tips
*** Foo
Bar baz.

If the search terms were \"Org foo\", and this option were
disabled, the entry \"Bar baz\" would not be found, because the
term \"Org\" would not be tested against the path element
\"Org-mode\".  With this option enabled, the entry would be
found, because \"Org\" is part of the entry's outline path.

In comparison, consider this outline:

* Emacs
** Org-mode
** Tips
*** Foo
Bar baz Org-mode.

With the same search terms and this option disabled, the entry
\"Bar baz Org-mode\" would be found, because it contains \"Org\".

Perhaps a helpful way to think about this option is to think of
it as a search engine testing against a Web page's URL.  When
disabled, search terms must be contained in pages' contents.
When enabled, the URL itself is considered as part of pages'
contents.  Of course, one would usually want to leave it enabled
for a Web search--but imagine that looking up pages' URLs
required an additional, very slow database query: it might be
better to leave it disabled by default."
  :type 'boolean)

(defcustom org-rifle-always-test-excludes-against-path t
  "Always test excluded terms against entries' outline paths.
Similarly to `org-rifle-test-against-path', this option may
cause a significant performance penalty.  However, unlike that
option, this one only takes effect when exclude patterns are
used (ones starting with \"!\") to negate potential matches.  It
is probably more important to check excluded terms against all
possible parts of an entry, and excluded terms are not used most
of the time, so this option is enabled by default, in the hope
that it will provide the most useful behavior by default.

Consider this outline:

* Food
** Fruits
*** Strawberry
Sweet and red in color.
** Vegetables
*** Chili pepper
Spicy and red in color.

If the search terms were \"red !fruit\", and this option were
enabled, the entry \"Strawberry\" would be excluded, because the
word \"Fruit\" is in its outline path.  But if this option were
disabled, the entry would be included, because its outline path
would be ignored."
